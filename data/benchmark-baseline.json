    "DiskIO: Based on SATA SSD minimum performance (100 MB/s write, 150 MB/s read)",
    "Network: Assumes reasonable internet connection with GitHub API access",
    "DotNet: Simple console app build should complete in under 30 seconds",
    "Python: Startup and simple script execution for basic CI tasks",
    "Git: Small repository clone (e.g., github/gitignore) should complete quickly",

    "Performance grades help categorize runner quality: Excellent (production-ready), Good (acceptable), Adequate (minimum viable), Poor (needs improvement)"
