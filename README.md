# ActionRunner - Irsik Software Build Infrastructure

Welcome! This is the build infrastructure for **Dakota Irsik / Irsik Software** repositories. If you're an AI assistant helping build applications in our org, you're in the right place.

## üëã For AI Assistants (Claude, etc.)

This repository configures our self-hosted GitHub Actions runners. When you're helping build apps in the Irsik Software organization, workflows will run on these runners instead of GitHub's hosted infrastructure.

### Build Capabilities

Our runners support these build environments:

| Capability | Status | Frameworks/Tools |
|------------|--------|------------------|
| ‚öôÔ∏è **Core Infrastructure** | ‚úì Ready | Runner management, health checks, monitoring |
| üåê **Web Applications** | ‚ö† Partial | Python, .NET, Node.js, pnpm |
| üê≥ **Docker & Containers** | ‚ö† Partial | Docker Desktop, WSL2, container builds |
| üîÑ **Integration & Workflows** | ‚úì Ready | GitHub Actions, workflow automation |
| üì± **Mobile Apps** | ‚è≥ Planned | Unity, Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter |
| ü§ñ **AI/LLM** | ‚è≥ Planned | LangChain, OpenAI, vector databases |

See [CAPABILITY-TESTING.md](CAPABILITY-TESTING.md) for detailed capability status and [test-improvement-roadmap.csv](test-improvement-roadmap.csv) for our improvement plan.

### How to Use in Your Workflows

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Always use Docker containers for isolation and pre-installed dependencies.**

When creating GitHub Actions workflows for Irsik Software repos, use containerized jobs:

```yaml
name: Build and Test

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  # Python projects - use multi-Python container
  python-tests:
    runs-on: [self-hosted, windows, docker]
    container:
      image: runner-python-multi:latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Run tests with Python 3.12
        shell: powershell
        run: python -m pytest tests/

      - name: Run tests with Python 3.10
        shell: powershell
        run: C:\Python310\python.exe -m pytest tests/

  # .NET projects - use .NET container
  dotnet-build:
    runs-on: [self-hosted, windows, docker]
    container:
      image: runner-dotnet:latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Build
        shell: powershell
        run: dotnet build

      - name: Test
        shell: powershell
        run: dotnet test
```

**Important Notes:**
- ‚úÖ **DO** use `container:` with pre-built images for isolation
- ‚úÖ **DO** use `runs-on: [self-hosted, windows, docker]` for our runners
- ‚úÖ **DO** use `shell: powershell` or `shell: pwsh` (both available in containers)
- ‚ùå **DON'T** use `actions/setup-python@v5` - Python is pre-installed in containers
- ‚ùå **DON'T** install dependencies on host - use containers

### Testing Your Workflows

Before pushing workflow changes, you can test our runner capabilities:

```powershell
# Test all capabilities
.\scripts\run-tests-by-capability.ps1 -Capability All

# Test specific capability
.\scripts\run-tests-by-capability.ps1 -Capability WebApp
.\scripts\run-tests-by-capability.ps1 -Capability Docker
```

### Current Runner Assignments

| Repository | Runner Name | Platform | Labels |
|------------|-------------|----------|--------|
| ActionRunner | actionrunner-runner | Windows | `self-hosted`, `windows`, `docker` |
| qiflow | qiflow-runner | Windows | `self-hosted`, `windows`, `docker` |
| qiflowgo | qiflowgo-runner | Windows | `self-hosted`, `windows`, `docker` |
| gifdistributor | gifdistributor-runner | Windows | `self-hosted`, `windows`, `docker` |
| *TBD* | linux-runner | Linux | `self-hosted`, `linux`, `docker` |

**Multi-Platform Support:**
- **Windows runners:** For Windows-specific builds, .NET, Unity
- **Linux runners:** For cross-platform testing, performance
- **macOS runners:** (Future) For iOS/macOS builds - requires Mac hardware

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions (For Infrastructure Admins)

### Quick Start - Dual Runner Setup (Recommended!)

**üéØ Best Setup:** TWO runners on ONE Windows machine with WSL2!

```powershell
cd C:\Code\ActionRunner

# Step 1: Install Linux runner in WSL2 (5-10 min)
# Get runner token from: https://github.com/YOUR-ORG/YOUR-REPO/settings/actions/runners
.\scripts\setup-wsl2-runner.ps1 `
  -RepoUrl "https://github.com/DakotaIrsik/QiFlow" `
  -Token "YOUR_RUNNER_TOKEN" `
  -RunnerName "qiflow-linux-runner"

# Step 2: Build Windows Python container (10-15 min)
.\scripts\build-python-image.ps1

# Step 3: Check both runners
.\scripts\manage-runners.ps1 -Action status
```

**You'll have:**
- ‚úÖ Windows runner (already installed) ‚Üí For .NET, Unity, Windows builds
- ‚úÖ Linux runner (in WSL2) ‚Üí For Python, Node, faster builds with `container:` keyword

cd ActionRunner
sudo ./scripts/setup-linux-runner.sh \
  --repo-url https://github.com/DakotaIrsik/YOUR-REPO \
  --token YOUR_TOKEN
```
