# ActionRunner

A secure, self-hosted GitHub Actions runner setup for Windows environments with comprehensive security controls and best practices.

## ⚠️ Security Notice

**CRITICAL**: Self-hosted runners should NEVER be used with public repositories or untrusted pull requests. Malicious code can execute arbitrary commands, steal secrets, and compromise your infrastructure.

For detailed security information, see [Security Documentation](docs/security.md).

## Quick Start

### 1. Download and Install GitHub Actions Runner

```powershell
# Create runner directory
mkdir C:\actions-runner
cd C:\actions-runner

# Download the latest runner (check GitHub for current version)
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/download/v2.311.0/actions-runner-win-x64-2.311.0.zip -OutFile actions-runner-win-x64.zip

# Extract
Add-Type -AssemblyName System.IO.Compression.FileSystem
[System.IO.Compression.ZipFile]::ExtractToDirectory("$PWD\actions-runner-win-x64.zip", "$PWD")
```

### 2. Security Setup (REQUIRED)

**Before configuring the runner, implement security controls:**

```powershell
# Run as Administrator

# Step 1: Create secure service account with limited permissions
.\config\runner-user-setup.ps1

# Step 2: Apply firewall rules for network isolation
.\config\apply-firewall-rules.ps1

# Step 3: Review and customize security settings
notepad .\docs\security.md
notepad .\config\firewall-rules.yaml
```

### 3. Configure Runner

```powershell
# Configure the runner (use the service account created above)
.\config.cmd --url https://github.com/YOUR-ORG/YOUR-REPO --token YOUR-TOKEN --runasservice

# When prompted, use the GitHubRunner account created by runner-user-setup.ps1
```

### 4. Verify Security Configuration

```powershell
# Check service is running as limited user
Get-Service actions.runner.* | Select-Object Name, Status, StartType

# Verify firewall rules are active
Get-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "GitHub Actions Runner*"

# Test runner
cd C:\actions-runner
.\run.cmd
```

### Updating the Runner

```powershell
# Stop the service
Stop-Service actions.runner.*

# Download and extract new version (check GitHub for latest)
# Then re-run config

# Start the service
Start-Service actions.runner.*
```

## Troubleshooting

### Runner Won't Start
1. Check service account permissions
2. Verify firewall rules allow GitHub connectivity
3. Review logs in `_diag` directory

### Network Connectivity Issues
1. Test HTTPS connectivity: `Test-NetConnection github.com -Port 443`
2. Review firewall logs
3. Verify DNS resolution

### Permission Denied Errors
1. Ensure service account has access to runner directory
2. Check file system permissions
3. Review Windows Event Logs
