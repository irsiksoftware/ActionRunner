# ActionRunner - Irsik Software Build Infrastructure

Welcome! This is the build infrastructure for **Dakota Irsik / Irsik Software** repositories. If you're an AI assistant helping build applications in our org, you're in the right place.

## üöÄ NEW: Organization-Level Runner Pool (Recommended)

**Deploy 3-10+ runners for parallel builds across ALL repos!**

Organization-level runners are shared across all repositories in irsiksoftware (LogSmith, LogSmithPro, CandyRush, etc.). This is the recommended approach for maximum efficiency and scalability.

### Quick Deploy (3 Runners)

```powershell
# Get token from: https://github.com/organizations/irsiksoftware/settings/actions/runners/new

cd C:\Code\ActionRunner

.\scripts\deploy-runner-pool.ps1 `
    -OrgName "irsiksoftware" `
    -Token "YOUR_TOKEN_HERE" `
    -Count 3
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ **Shared Infrastructure** - One runner pool serves all repos
- ‚úÖ **Auto-Detection** - Capabilities detected automatically (Unity, GPU, Docker, etc.)
- ‚úÖ **Easy Scaling** - Add runners without updating workflows
- ‚úÖ **Parallel Builds** - 3 runners = 3√ó faster CI (15min ‚Üí 5min for Unity builds)

**Usage in workflows:**
```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: [self-hosted, unity-pool]  # Uses any available org runner
```

## üëã For AI Assistants (Claude, etc.)

This repository configures our self-hosted GitHub Actions runners. When you're helping build apps in the Irsik Software organization, workflows will run on these runners instead of GitHub's hosted infrastructure.

### Build Capabilities

Our runners support these build environments:

| Capability | Status | Frameworks/Tools |
|------------|--------|------------------|
| ‚öôÔ∏è **Core Infrastructure** | ‚úì Ready | Runner management, health checks, monitoring |
| üåê **Web Applications** | ‚ö† Partial | Python, .NET, Node.js, pnpm |
| üê≥ **Docker & Containers** | ‚ö† Partial | Docker Desktop, WSL2, container builds |
| üîÑ **Integration & Workflows** | ‚úì Ready | GitHub Actions, workflow automation |
| üì± **Mobile Apps** | ‚è≥ Planned | Unity, Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter |
| ü§ñ **AI/LLM** | ‚è≥ Planned | LangChain, OpenAI, vector databases |

See [CAPABILITY-TESTING.md](CAPABILITY-TESTING.md) for detailed capability status and [test-improvement-roadmap.csv](test-improvement-roadmap.csv) for our improvement plan.

### How to Use in Your Workflows

**Recommended: Use org-level runners with capability-based labels**

When creating GitHub Actions workflows for Irsik Software repos, use the shared runner pool:

```yaml
name: Build and Test

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  # Unity projects - use unity-pool label
  unity-build:
    runs-on: [self-hosted, unity-pool]  # Auto-assigned to any available runner with Unity

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Run Unity Tests
        shell: powershell
        run: |
          # Unity build commands here
          # Runners have Unity 2022.3, 2023.2, and 6000.0 installed

  # GPU-accelerated builds
  gpu-build:
    runs-on: [self-hosted, gpu, nvidia]  # Requires runner with NVIDIA GPU

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: GPU-accelerated task
        run: # Your GPU task

  # Docker builds
  docker-build:
    runs-on: [self-hosted, docker]  # Requires runner with Docker

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Build in Docker
        shell: powershell
        run: |
          docker build -t myapp .
          docker run --rm myapp npm test
```

**Legacy approach (still supported):**

For Docker containerized builds with pre-installed dependencies:

```yaml
jobs:
  # Python projects - use multi-Python container
  python-tests:
    runs-on: [self-hosted, windows, docker]
    container:
      image: runner-python-multi:latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Run tests with Python 3.12
        shell: powershell
        run: python -m pytest tests/
```

**Important Notes:**
- ‚úÖ **DO** use `container:` with pre-built images for isolation
- ‚úÖ **DO** use `runs-on: [self-hosted, windows, docker]` for our runners
- ‚úÖ **DO** use `shell: powershell` or `shell: pwsh` (both available in containers)
- ‚ùå **DON'T** use `actions/setup-python@v5` - Python is pre-installed in containers
- ‚ùå **DON'T** install dependencies on host - use containers

### Testing Your Workflows

Before pushing workflow changes, you can test our runner capabilities:

```powershell
# Test all capabilities
.\scripts\run-tests-by-capability.ps1 -Capability All

# Test specific capability
.\scripts\run-tests-by-capability.ps1 -Capability WebApp
.\scripts\run-tests-by-capability.ps1 -Capability Docker
```

### Current Runner Assignments

| Repository | Runner Name | Platform | Labels |
|------------|-------------|----------|--------|
| ActionRunner | actionrunner-runner | Windows | `self-hosted`, `windows`, `docker` |
| qiflow | qiflow-runner | Windows | `self-hosted`, `windows`, `docker` |
| qiflowgo | qiflowgo-runner | Windows | `self-hosted`, `windows`, `docker` |
| gifdistributor | gifdistributor-runner | Windows | `self-hosted`, `windows`, `docker` |
| *TBD* | linux-runner | Linux | `self-hosted`, `linux`, `docker` |

**Multi-Platform Support:**
- **Windows runners:** For Windows-specific builds, .NET, Unity
- **Linux runners:** For cross-platform testing, performance
- **macOS runners:** (Future) For iOS/macOS builds - requires Mac hardware

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions (For Infrastructure Admins)

### Quick Start - Dual Runner Setup (Recommended!)

**üéØ Best Setup:** TWO runners on ONE Windows machine with WSL2!

```powershell
cd C:\Code\ActionRunner

# Step 1: Install Linux runner in WSL2 (5-10 min)
# Get runner token from: https://github.com/YOUR-ORG/YOUR-REPO/settings/actions/runners
.\scripts\setup-wsl2-runner.ps1 `
  -RepoUrl "https://github.com/DakotaIrsik/QiFlow" `
  -Token "YOUR_RUNNER_TOKEN" `
  -RunnerName "qiflow-linux-runner"

# Step 2: Build Windows Python container (10-15 min)
.\scripts\build-python-image.ps1

# Step 3: Check both runners
.\scripts\manage-runners.ps1 -Action status
```

**You'll have:**
- ‚úÖ Windows runner (already installed) ‚Üí For .NET, Unity, Windows builds
- ‚úÖ Linux runner (in WSL2) ‚Üí For Python, Node, faster builds with `container:` keyword

### Legacy Windows Setup (Manual)

<details>
<summary>Click to expand manual Windows setup steps</summary>

1. **Download GitHub Actions Runner**

```powershell
mkdir C:\actions-runner
cd C:\actions-runner

# Download the latest runner (check GitHub for current version)
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/download/v2.328.0/actions-runner-win-x64-2.328.0.zip -OutFile actions-runner-win-x64.zip

Add-Type -AssemblyName System.IO.Compression.FileSystem
[System.IO.Compression.ZipFile]::ExtractToDirectory("$PWD\actions-runner-win-x64.zip", "$PWD")
```

2. **Security Setup (Required)**

Clone this repository and run the security scripts:

```powershell
# Run as Administrator
cd C:\

# Clone the ActionRunner repository
git clone https://github.com/DakotaIrsik/ActionRunner.git
cd ActionRunner

# Create service account
.\config\runner-user-setup.ps1

# Apply firewall rules
.\config\apply-firewall-rules.ps1

# Step 3: Review security settings
notepad .\docs\security.md
notepad .\config\firewall-rules.yaml
```

3. **Register Runner**

```powershell
# Get token from GitHub: Settings ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí Runners ‚Üí New runner
# Configure the runner (use the service account created above)
# Replace YOUR-REPO with your target repository name (e.g., qiflow, gifdistributor)
# Get YOUR-TOKEN from GitHub: Settings ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí Runners ‚Üí New self-hosted runner
.\config.cmd --url https://github.com/DakotaIrsik/YOUR-REPO --token YOUR-TOKEN --runasservice

# When prompted, use the GitHubRunner account created by runner-user-setup.ps1
```

4. **Verify Installation**

```powershell
# Check service status
Get-Service actions.runner.* | Select-Object Name, Status, StartType

# Run capability tests
.\scripts\run-tests-by-capability.ps1 -Capability All
```

## Using the Self-Hosted Runners

### Available Runners

The following self-hosted runners are configured and available:

| Repository | Runner Labels | Docker Support |
|------------|---------------|----------------|
| **ActionRunner** | `self-hosted`, `windows`, `docker` | ‚úÖ |
| **qiflow** | `self-hosted`, `windows`, `docker` | ‚úÖ |
| **qiflowgo** | `self-hosted`, `windows`, `docker` | ‚úÖ |
| **gifdistributor** | `self-hosted`, `windows`, `docker` | ‚úÖ |

**Note**: The `docker` label is optional. Use `runs-on: [self-hosted, windows]` for standard workflows, or add `docker` when you need container isolation.

### Workflow Configuration

To use the self-hosted runners in your GitHub Actions workflows, specify the runner labels in the `runs-on` field:

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, feature/* ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build-and-test:
    name: Build and Test
    runs-on: [self-hosted, windows, docker]  # Use self-hosted runner

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Run tests
        shell: powershell  # Use 'powershell' not 'pwsh'
        run: |
          Write-Host "Running tests..."
          # Your test commands here
```

### Shell Compatibility

**IMPORTANT:** Use `shell: powershell` (Windows PowerShell) instead of `shell: pwsh` (PowerShell Core):

```yaml
# ‚úÖ CORRECT - Use Windows PowerShell
- name: My Step
  shell: powershell
  run: |
    Write-Host "This works!"

# ‚ùå INCORRECT - PowerShell Core not installed
- name: My Step
  shell: pwsh
  run: |
    Write-Host "This fails!"
```

### Docker Isolation

All runners support Docker for containerized builds:

```yaml
jobs:
  docker-build:
    runs-on: [self-hosted, windows, docker]

    steps:
      - name: Build in Docker
        shell: powershell
        run: |
          docker build -t myapp .
          docker run --rm myapp npm test
```

### Example Workflows

See the workflow in this repository for a complete example:
- **[.github/workflows/ci.yml](.github/workflows/ci.yml)** - CI/CD pipeline with tests and validation

### Best Practices

1. **Always specify runner labels explicitly**: `runs-on: [self-hosted, windows, docker]`
2. **Use `powershell` shell**: Avoid `pwsh` as PowerShell Core is not installed
3. **Avoid UTF-8 special characters**: Use `[OK]` instead of `‚úì` in PowerShell output
4. **Clean up after jobs**: Use `if: always()` for cleanup steps
5. **Use Docker for untrusted code**: Isolate builds in containers when possible

## Jesus Project Runner Setup

For the **Jesus MCP Agentic AI Platform** project, which requires Node.js, Python, and Docker support, use the development stack installation script:

### Quick Setup (Windows)

```powershell
# 1. Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/DakotaIrsik/ActionRunner.git
cd ActionRunner

# 2. Run the environment setup script
.\scripts\setup-runner-environment.ps1

# 3. Verify installation
node --version     # Should show v20.x
pnpm --version     # Should show 9.x
python --version   # Should show 3.11.x
docker --version
```

### Stack Components

The setup script (`setup-runner-environment.ps1`) installs:

- **Node.js 20.x** with **pnpm 9.x** for JavaScript/TypeScript builds
- **Python 3.11** with **pip**, **pip-audit**, and **detect-secrets** for security scanning
- **Docker** verification and configuration
- **OSV Scanner** for vulnerability scanning

### Usage in Jesus Workflows

Update your Jesus project workflows to use the self-hosted runner:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: [self-hosted, windows, docker]

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Install dependencies
        shell: powershell
        run: pnpm install

      - name: Run build
        shell: powershell
        run: pnpm build

      - name: Run tests
        shell: powershell
        run: pnpm test
```
